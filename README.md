# Getting Started

This is a personal exercise for the algorithm(fourth edition).
The project will go on and on and I'll try to include detailed comments in the code.

## About Library

In order to make readers focus on the use of learning algorithms, the book algorithm encapsulate common methods into library 'algs4.jar', which can be downloaded from the official website of Algorithms.
<https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/>

For your convenience, I have also uploaded the contents of this library to the project and placed it under the file 'lib'.
Don't forget to add the library to **CLASSPATH**.
